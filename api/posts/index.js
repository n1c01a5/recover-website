They contain a large part of your private and personal life which cannot be replaced easily no matter what the cost is. For example, memories from the last vacation or the access code to your house, a smartphone has the power to store all of it.</p><p>Nowadays, there is nothing worse for a person than losing his phone. The phone is not just about making calls and just knowing that a stranger is looking at all your data can drive you crazy. Fortunately, it is possible to find your phone and to prevent the loss of your data and sleep.</p><p>Letâ€™s look at 3 steps that you can follow in case of loss and 2 tools that can help insure the recovery in case of loss.</p><p> Here is what you should do immediately after the phone is lost</p></section><section class="section-1"><h2>What measures to take right after the Phone is lost? </h2><h3>1. Call or text your phone</h3><p>The first thing you should do is always call it from another number. Perhaps it is possible you have misplaced it somewhere near you and you can hear the snooze or beep sound to retrieve it easily.</p><p>If it is nowhere near you and you have realised that you have indeed lost your phone, it is possible that an honest finder is trying to return it but has no means to reach you if the phone is locked. Your call/text can help you connect to the finder who can be waiting for it. If you cannot find a person nearby whose phone you can use, free websites like text2day.com can help you send a message to your number right away. Also, you can offer compensation to the person for their goodwill by communicating via call/text to increase your chances of return.</p><h3>2. Retrace your steps</h3><p>Retracing your steps can help you find your phone if you are sure you did not lose it in a busy area like airports, railway stations, restaurants, etc.. This way the chances are high that no one saw your phone lying unattended and you can find it by retracing your steps. It is important to keep in mind that you have to avoid panic. Panicking can worsen the situation and you can have trouble remembering the last location of your phone. If you were in a restaurant or shop before losing it, ask an employee if anyone found or reported a lost phone. If so, just give a description of your phone or give your number for the employee to call to have a safe return.</p><h3>3. Locate your Phone - Location tracking service</h3><p>If you were unable to get someone on the other side then try finding it with phone GPS service. For this feature to run smoothly you should have this feature activated on your device so it can be accessed from another machine. Android device manager and Find my iPhone helps you do this as well.</p><h2>Here is the detailed description of how you can use the location service on Android and IOS devices</h2></section><section class="section-2"><div class="android"><h3>Learn how to locate an Android phone:</h3><p>There are 2 ways to find an Android phone.</p><ul><li>If the device is still on and connected to a wireless network, use Device Manager.</li><li>If it is off and off-grid, you can still locate its last known location from a computer.</li><p>To use Device Manager:</p><ul><li>Sign in to your Google Account from a computer or other device.

To disable your number, some phone operators will also ask you for this report.</p></li><li><h3>Reset your passwords and login information: </h3><p>Perhaps the most important measure to take to limit the damage. Irrespective of your usage of the phone, go on the Internet, you will need to reset your passwords and login information as soon as possible. For some people, it may not be necessary, but for others, the risk could be considerable. First, change your most important passwords like bank accounts and then change email passwords, social media, etc. You may also need to immediately cancel credit cards or debit cards registered online from this device (for example, cards stored on the App Store).</p></li><li><h3>Contact your telephone company: </h3><p>Keep your account information handy so you can close it.

The payer is usually concerned about the products/services they will receive and payee for money being received. To fix this, an escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party is responsible for regulating and payment of funds which is required for multiple parties involved in a given transaction. The third-party involved only release the funds when all terms of the contract are respected. It helps in the transaction being more secure as the funds are kept in an escrow account which is managed by the<a class="blog_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_dispute_resolution">arbitrator</a>. Also, it adds an extra level of trust both parties have for the Escrow so chances of foul play are less. There are certain obligations that need to be fulfilled before a payment is released and in case the terms of the contract are not respected a dispute can be raised. Escrow technology takes care of your transaction without fraud or risk of losing money. It is always better to trust Escrow than making a handshake deal which can result in foul play afterward.</p></section><section class="blog__section"><h2>How Escrow Financial Transaction Works?</h2><p>Initially, either the payee or the payer approaches Escrow which acts as an arbitrator, the terms and conditions should be agreed upon before the transaction is started.<ul class="blog__list"><li>The buyer puts the payment to escrow to purchase a product or service.</li><li>Then, the seller ships the product or the service to the buyer.</li><li>If everything works well, the buyer releases the funds to the seller. If not, a dispute can be created and the arbitrator will solve it.</li></ul></p></section><section class="blog__section"><h2>What is an Escrow Smart Contract?</h2><p>A smart contract is a program that is smart enough to execute a piece of code instructions when conditions are met. Also, smart contracts do not require any third-party control and run solely on the basis of pre-programmed logic which is overseen by a distributed, decentralized network of computers that runs on<a class="blog_link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp#what-is-blockchain">blockchain</a>. It is a computer protocol that is used to digitally and automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the terms of a contract. The main benefit of the Escrow smart contract is to reduce the dependency of intermediates, centralized arbitrators to help reduce fraud transactions. The program automatically validates a condition and determines whether an asset will go to one person or back to the person who sent it. It is interesting to know that during the process, the<a class="blog_link" href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/distributed-ledger">distributed ledger</a> <!-- -->can also store and make a copy of the document which provides added security and immutability.</p></section><section class="blog__section"><h2>Main Advantages of using Escrow Smart Contracts</h2><div><p><strong>Smart Contract enforcement:</strong> Smart contracts are enforced the same way as normal programs are done. Smart contracts are similar to real-world contracts but not exactly. In the real world, if a contract is broken you can take the person to court but in the case of smart contracts, there are predefined rules that are defined by parties and enforced by the blockchain. Itâ€™s smart contract enforcement.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Decentralized (reduce conflict interest) with<!-- --> <a class="blog_link" href="https://kleros.io/">Kleros</a>/<a class="blog_link no_left_margin" href="https://aragon.org/blog/aragon-network-jurisdiction-part-1-decentralized-court-c8ab2a675e82">Aragon</a></strong>: The arbitration is decentralized and if any conflict of interest arises, it is being dealt with<!-- --> <a class="blog_link" href="https://kleros.io/">Kleros</a>, a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) to solve disputes.</p><p><strong>Interoperable (switch the arbitrator)</strong>: Escrow smart contracts are Interoperable that means if you donâ€™t trust the arbitrator you can easily change the arbitrator, being said the smart contract follows the arbitrator standard.

With an escrow smart contract, you can be sure that your fund is never lost because it uses blockchain protocol with high availability.</p><p><strong>Cheap</strong>: Smart contracts act as a less expensive way of doing business between two or more parties. In case of any dispute, you just have to pay the arbitration fee. Also, decentralized arbitrators like Kleros are cheap and affordable as they use a crowd of jurors to reduce the cost of arbitration.</p></div></section><section class="blog__section"><h2>Escrow Smart Contract implementation with Recover</h2><p><ul class="blog__list"><li>The finder finds your lost valuable.</li><li>The honest finder will definitely return your valuable, but the dishonest person (who is not willing to not return the product) on seeing the reward capped higher than the market price is incentivized to return it to the owner.</li><li> When the item is returned the finder gets the reward.</li><li>If not, a dispute is created which is handled by the arbitrator.</li></ul></p></section><section class="blog__section"><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Escrow financial agreement not only helps make the transaction secure but also adds more trust among two parties.
