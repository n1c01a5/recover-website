            Smartphones have taken place as one of the most personal and
            important tools in today's world. They contain a large part of your
            private and personal life which cannot be replaced easily no matter
            what the cost is. For example, memories from the last vacation or
            the access code to your house, a smartphone has the power to store
            all of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, there is nothing worse for a person than losing his phone.
            The phone is not just about making calls and just knowing that a
            stranger is looking at all your data can drive you crazy.
            Fortunately, it is possible to find your phone and to prevent the
            loss of your data and sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s look at 3 steps that you can follow in case of loss and 2
            tools that can help insure the recovery in case of loss.
          </p>
          <p> Here is what you should do immediately after the phone is lost</p>
        </section>
        <section className="section-1">
          <h2>What measures to take right after the Phone is lost? </h2>

          <h3>1. Call or text your phone</h3>
          <p>
            The first thing you should do is always call it from another number.
            Perhaps it is possible you have misplaced it somewhere near you and
            you can hear the snooze or beep sound to retrieve it easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it is nowhere near you and you have realised that you have indeed
            lost your phone, it is possible that an honest finder is trying to
            return it but has no means to reach you if the phone is locked. Your
            call/text can help you connect to the finder who can be waiting for
            it. If you cannot find a person nearby whose phone you can use, free
            websites like text2day.com can help you send a message to your
            number right away. Also, you can offer compensation to the person
            for their goodwill by communicating via call/text to increase your
            chances of return.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Retrace your steps</h3>
          <p>
            Retracing your steps can help you find your phone if you are sure
            you did not lose it in a busy area like airports, railway stations,
            restaurants, etc.. This way the chances are high that no one saw
            your phone lying unattended and you can find it by retracing your
            steps. It is important to keep in mind that you have to avoid panic.
            Panicking can worsen the situation and you can have trouble
            remembering the last location of your phone. If you were in a
            restaurant or shop before losing it, ask an employee if anyone found
            or reported a lost phone. If so, just give a description of your
            phone or give your number for the employee to call to have a safe
            return.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Locate your Phone - Location tracking service</h3>
          <p>
            If you were unable to get someone on the other side then try finding
            it with phone GPS service. For this feature to run smoothly you
            should have this feature activated on your device so it can be
            accessed from another machine. Android device manager and Find my
            iPhone helps you do this as well.
          </p>

            <h3>Learn how to locate an Android phone:</h3>
            <p>There are 2 ways to find an Android phone.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the device is still on and connected to a wireless network,
                use Device Manager.
              </li>
              <li>
                If it is off and off-grid, you can still locate its last known
                location from a computer.
              </li>
              <p>To use Device Manager:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sign in to your Google Account from a computer or other
                  device. You will instantly see where your phone is on Google
                  Maps. You can also lock it, ring it, or erase its contents and
                  data remotely.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You will find the last known location of your phone on the
                  page you have. Click Location History and then click Manage
                  History. This method uses Wi-Fi and mobile signals rather than
                  GPS. The location of your phone will not be as accurate as
                  with the Device Manager.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Learn how to locate an iPhone (IOS):</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Find My iPhone app is the best way to locate a lost iPhone.
                If it is not installed on your phone, you will first need to
                download it from the App Store. The application is fairly
                accurate, but for it to work, your iPhone must be turned on and
                connected to the Internet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sign in to your iCloud from a computer or other mobile device
                and open Find My iPhone. You will need to see the location of
                your phone on a map and you will be able to track its movements
                as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                Find My iPhone makes it possible to remotely ring the phone (to
                locate and make people understand that it is lost or stolen), to
                send a text message with your details or to delete its content
                and its data.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>Call the Police:</h3>
                <p>
                  If you are sure that your device has been stolen, do not try
                  to recover it yourself. Call the police and let them handle
                  the situation for you. Going after the thief by yourself can
                  be dangerous for you. Report the theft to the nearest police
                  station: A police report will be required to submit a claim
                  file to your insurer. To disable your number, some phone
                  operators will also ask you for this report.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Reset your passwords and login information: </h3>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the most important measure to take to limit the
                  damage. Irrespective of your usage of the phone, go on the
                  Internet, you will need to reset your passwords and login
                  information as soon as possible. For some people, it may not
                  be necessary, but for others, the risk could be considerable.
                  First, change your most important passwords like bank accounts
                  and then change email passwords, social media, etc. You may
                  also need to immediately cancel credit cards or debit cards
                  registered online from this device (for example, cards stored
                  on the App Store).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Contact your telephone company: </h3>
                <p>
                  Keep your account information handy so you can close it. If
                  you have set a password or access code for your account, you
                  will also need it. Disabling your SIM card will prevent the
                  thief (or the person who found your phone) making calls using
                  your number. If you have a postpaid plan and you were not able
                  to find your phone within 2 hours, call your telephone company
                  right away and ask them to deactivate your number.

              Lost phones are sometimes returned, but their owners no longer
              claim them because they think no one would be nice enough to
              return them.

            <li>
              The application allows ringing the Tile or beep if the object in
              question is near.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>How are they doing it? Technology behind Tile</h4>
          <p>
            They use Bluetooth trackers to find the lost device. Usually,
            Bluetooth works well within a shorter range and is dependent on a
            connection to a Bluetooth enabled device.
          </p>
          <h4>Advantages of Bluetooth based tracking systems:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It avoids interference from other wireless devices and is only
              connected to a particular device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Devices have low power consumption and can be easily updated to
              the latest model.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Generally offers limited functionality when it comes to range. The
              maximum range can be 20 meters which are significantly low for
              finding your lost phone. Anything above 20 meters becomes
              irretrievable.
            </li>
            <li>
              The inability of the Bluetooth based tracking device to track the
              physical location of the person.
            </li>
          </ul>
