      <p class="image-prescription">Losing a phone is like losing yourself in wide unknown space</p>

      <p>
        Smartphones have taken place as one of the most personal and important
        tools in today's world. They contain a large part of your private and
        personal life which cannot be replaced easily no matter what the cost
        is. For example, memories from the last vacation or the access code to
        your house, a smartphone has the power to store all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, there is nothing worse for a person than losing his phone. The
        phone is not just about making calls and just knowing that a stranger is
        looking at all your data can drive you crazy. Fortunately, it is
        possible to find your phone and to prevent the loss of your data and
        sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s look at 3 steps that you can follow in case of loss and 2 tools
        that can help insure the recovery in case of loss.
      </p>
      <p> Here is what you should do immediately after the phone is lost</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section1">
      <h2>What measures to take right after the Phone is lost? </h2>

      <h3>1. Call or text your phone</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing you should do is always call it from another number.
        Perhaps it is possible you have misplaced it somewhere near you and you
        can hear the snooze or beep sound to retrieve it easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is nowhere near you and you have realized that you have indeed
        lost your phone, it is possible that an honest finder is trying to
        return it but has no means to reach you if the phone is locked. Your
        call/text can help you connect to the finder who can be waiting for it.
        If you cannot find a person nearby whose phone you can use, free
        websites like <a href="text2day.com">text2day.com</a> can help you send a message to your number
        right away. Also, you can offer compensation to the person for their
        goodwill by communicating via call/text to increase your chances of
        return.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Retrace your steps</h3>
      <p>
        Retracing your steps can help you find your phone if you are sure you
        did not lose it in a busy area like airports, railway stations,
        restaurants, etc.. This way the chances are high that no one saw your
        phone lying unattended and you can find it by retracing your steps. It
        is important to keep in mind that you have to avoid panic. Panicking can
        worsen the situation and you can have trouble remembering the last
        location of your phone. If you were in a restaurant or shop before
        losing it, ask an employee if anyone found or reported a lost phone. If
        so, just give a description of your phone or give your number for the
        employee to call to have a safe return.
      </p>

      <p class="image-prescription">Retracing your steps helps, but only if you are moving in right direction</p>

      <h3>3. Locate your Phone - Location tracking service</h3>
      <p>
        If you were unable to get someone on the other side then try finding it
        with phone GPS service. For this feature to run smoothly you should have
        this feature activated on your device so it can be accessed from another
        machine. Android device manager and Find my iPhone helps you do this as
        well.

              Sign in to your Google Account from a computer or other device.
              You will instantly see where your phone is on Google Maps. You can
              also lock it, ring it, or erase its contents and data remotely.

              This method uses Wi-Fi and mobile signals rather than GPS. The
              location of your phone will not be as accurate as with the Device
              Manager.

        <ul class="decimal">
          <li>
            <h3>Call the Police:</h3>
            <p>
              If you are sure that your device has been stolen, do not try to
              recover it yourself. Call the police and let them handle the
              situation for you. Going after the thief by yourself can be
              dangerous for you. Report the theft to the nearest police station:
              A police report will be required to submit a claim file to your
              insurer. To disable your number, some phone operators will also
              ask you for this report.

          <li>
            <h3>Reset your passwords and login information: </h3>
            <p>
              Perhaps the most important measure to take to limit the damage.
              Irrespective of your usage of the phone, go on the Internet, you
              will need to reset your passwords and login information as soon as
              possible. For some people, it may not be necessary, but for
              others, the risk could be considerable. First, change your most
              important passwords like bank accounts and then change email
              passwords, social media, etc. You may also need to immediately
              cancel credit cards or debit cards registered online from this
              device (for example, cards stored on the App Store).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Contact your telephone company: </h3>
            <p>
              Keep your account information handy so you can close it. If you
              have set a password or access code for your account, you will also
              need it. Disabling your SIM card will prevent the thief (or the
              person who found your phone) making calls using your number. If
              you have a postpaid plan and you were not able to find your phone
              within 2 hours, call your telephone company right away and ask
              them to deactivate your number.

      <h3>1. Tile, a Bluetooth solution to find your Phone</h3>
      <p>
        Tile is one organization that helps users around the world locate lost
        items using Bluetooth trackers or where they were last seen.
      </p>
      <h4>What does it offer?</h4>
      <p>
        Tile offers a wide range of products which match your product needs. By
        attaching a tile (a hardware device) to a keychain or other item, a user
        can later use the Tile app to help locate the item if the object is lost
        or misplaced.

      <p class="image-prescription">You can find your product with Tile, but only if you are in range</p>

      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      <ul class="small-header">
        <li>
          <p>
            The application allows ringing the Tile or beep if the object in

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

      <h4>How are they doing it? Technology behind Tile</h4>
      <img class="recover-image bluetooth-image" src="${BluetoothImage}"></img>
      <p class="image-prescription">Bluetooth, the savior. Whether music or finding your valuable</p>
      <p>
        They use Bluetooth trackers to find the lost device. Usually, Bluetooth
        works well within a shorter range and is dependent on a connection to a
        Bluetooth enabled device.
      </p>
      <h4>Advantages of Bluetooth based tracking systems:</h4>
      <ul class="decimal small-header">
        <li>
          <p>
            It avoids interference from other wireless devices and is only
            connected to a particular device.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Devices have low power consumption and can be easily updated to the
            latest model.

      <h4>Disadvantages of Bluetooth based tracking systems:</h4>
      <ul class="decimal small-header">
        <li>
          <p>
            Generally offers limited functionality when it comes to range. The
            maximum range can be 20 meters which are significantly low for finding
            your lost phone. Anything above 20 meters becomes irretrievable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The inability of the Bluetooth based tracking device to track the

        the product as it offers a reward for the finder who on seeing the
        reward (which is capped higher than the market price) is incentivized to
        return the product to the owner. Alongside, Recover uses smart contracts
        to add more privacy, security and transparency to the transactions.
      </p>
      <h4>How it works - three easy steps</h4>
      <p>
        Recover offer it services with Loser Box which can be set up in three
        easy steps:

      <ul class="decimal small-header">
        <li>
          <p>
            With Recover’s Loser Box you receive QR codes which get linked to your
            valuables.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In case of loss, seeing the phone unattended the finder is
            incentivized to return it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>The reward is exchanged for the phone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now you have knowledge of what measures to take in case of the lost phone and
        about the companies that are using the latest technology to help prevent the
        loss. Recover can also be used alongside Tile to add an <a href="http://recover.ws/">extra cover of insurance for
        your valuables</a> and insure safe return in case of loss.
