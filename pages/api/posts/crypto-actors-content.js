          As Blockchain technology becomes more sophisticated and its adoption grows, new ideas spring out left,
          right and center. When we talk about actors of the Crypto ecosystem there are groups of players which
          interact with each other within the world of Blockchain and with the surrounding off-chain world.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the typical Blockchain ecosystem, actors include investors, builders, regular users, bidders and gamers,
          scammers, early adapters, traders and a mix of different categories. Moving forward, we will discuss the position
          that Recover holds in this ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us look one by one at the major actors which form the ecosystem and what role they play in shaping it up.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Crypto Investors: money, profits and the space in between</h2>
        <img class="image" src="${InvestorsNews}" alt="Crypto investors - Bitcoin" />
        <legend>
          Invest in crypto to be part of the ecosystem and gain huge chunks of money - Tom Lee
        </legend>
        <p class="content">
          Cryptocurrency offers investors a whole new world. Investors choose an asset as it helps them diversify
          a portfolio and to avoid risk in a particular sector. Gold and silver have traditionally been the investment
          of choice when diversifying portfolios and protecting investors against financial risk. Cryptocurrency is slowly
          becoming the new digital gold and silver playing the same role i.e. safeguarding investors against market crashes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cryptocurrency acts as a free playing ground for investors as it gives them an ability to convert funds into digital
          currency and hold them securely without relying on the banking system. Investors in the crypto ecosystem are also showing
          interest in yield farming which helps them gain rewards by locking up crypto currency.The rise of DeFi (Decentralized finance)
          is making crypto entrepreneurs recreate traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture outside of company and
          government control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover if we primarily look at the difference between an investor and a trader we can safely say that an investor looks for long
          term legitimate projects while a trader makes investment for a short term and adds liquidity to the system.

        <h2 class="title">Builders: Blockchain developers, entrepreneurs, crypto designers, artists; the ones who shape the ecosystem</h2>
        <img class="image" src="${BuidlerNewProjects}" alt="Buidler - blockchain developer" />
        <legend>So, what are you BUIDLing today? </legend>
        <p class="content">
          Builders in the cryptocurrency space constitute organizations, projects or people who have a vision to disrupt the market by
          using blockchain technology. Builders eye on adoption of blockchain technology in day to day tasks and experiment how blockchain
          can transform the daily lives of people without being dependent on a centralized authority. DeFi projects built on top of the Ethereum
          platform form a major chunk of this ecosystem with projects like Uniswap and Yield finance to name a few.
        </p>

        <h3>Synthetic Persona of a Buidler</h3>
        <img class="image" src="${BuidlersPersona}" alt="Synthetic Persona of a Buidler" />

        <h3>Typography of dApp projects</h3>

        Let us introduce five types of projects which help support the crypto ecosystem:

        <ol>
          <ul>Bad projects</ul>
          <ul>Illegal projects (loterry (pancakeswap), prediction murder, betting(orediction market))</ul>
          <ul>Scam projects</ul>
          <ul>Fun projects</ul>
          <ul>Legitimate projects</ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>Bad crypto project</h3>

        Architecture is bad because centralized, no plus-value, token completly useless or it's mote un grain de sel. fork le project et remove le token

        <p>
         Bad projects in the crypto ecosystem usually comprise actors that lack blockchain traceability. These include the projects on a decentralized exchange (DEX) which runs on software and allows users to trade cryptocurrency without dealing with fiat currency and customer verification. If something goes wrong, because all of the funds are present in crypto, it is very difficult for the victims to claim their fund.
        </p>

        <p>
          ???Sushiswap which was questioned for being an exit scam when it’s pseudonymous founder suddenly sold $13 million worth of tokens. All this came after sushi swap laid out a pretty agressive vampire attack by forking Uniswap project syphoning out of it’s liquidity to sushi platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because 1inch ???Sushiswap is one of the project’s which started out with lot’s of controversy and was marked as a bad project. It was questioned for being an exit scam when it’s pseudonymous founder suddenly sold $13 million worth of tokens.  The project has now has gained momentum and project stands as DeFi’s top 10 projects at this very moment. It’s difficult to mark Sushiswap as a bad project but we have to be very careful about the thin line present between being a bad project and good project, specially in blockchain space. All this came after sushi swap laid out a pretty agressive vampire attack by forking Uniswap project syphoning out of it’s liquidity to sushi platform. For more information on what is vampire attack check the link.
        </p>

        <h3>Illegal crypto project</h3>

        <p>
          Illegal projects consitutes projects which help or promotes cryptocurrency in buying goods or services which can be harmful to the
          society or are banned (for obvious reasons) by the government of the country. One such example can be betting using cryptocurrency
          which is being considered illegal depending upon laws imposed by particular country. One of the recent examples being Nigeria completely
          banning Bitcoin.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of other examples can be of the Silk Road project, though the project was not exactly bad, it later turned into an illegal playing
          field for selling drugs and weapons which led to its destruction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though some illegal projects are not scam, we see what scam projects really look like.
        </p>

        <h3>Scam crypto project</h3>

        <p>
          Scam projects usually constitutes project which are generated to gain interest of investors but does not contain solid foundation of how the project will function. One of the best ways to understand whether the project is scam is to thoroughly analyse the whitepaper. Companies that do not offer any whitepaper have to be ignored at any cost as white paper is the foundation of any good project.
        </p>

        <p>
        One of the examples of such scam project was Bitconnect which urged users to invest in Bitconnect platform to earn daily profits. Eventually Bitconnect turned out to be a scam and was shut down in January, 2018 as it was not able to justify it’s legitimacy and high price volatility.
        </p>

        Tres en vogue avec la bulle de 2017 ils ont commence a baissé puisque le marché c'est rationalisé. Avant il est courant de voir des projet lever des millions pour des whitepaper avec de 2-3 formules mathemetiques et vitalik comme advisor, a force que le marche se fasse arnaquer ces arnanques ont de moins en moins fonctionne.

        <h3>Fun crypto project</h3>

        <p>
        There are some projects in Blockchain which represent the fun side of the technology. These projects help to make full use of the Blockchain ecosystem by creating projects which comprise digital breeding of animals and some projects which started as fun but later gained popularity. Cryptokitty and Dogecoin are some of the examples of fun projects.
        </p>

        Dogecoin bien sur surtout soutenu par Elon, son dogefather. Il est légitime de se demander si ce n'est pas une variante de ponzi tellement les foncdamentaux sont pauvre mais apres tout on vit dans age of meme et le doge merite d'en etre le porte drapeau. Et quand bien meme ce serait un sorte de ponzi, le systeme financier mondiale n'en est-il pas un (lien) ? C'est un autre débat :p

        <h3>Legit crypto project</h3>

        <p>
          Legitimate projects are categorized as those which carry a tremendous amount of value for the Blockchain and Ethereum ecosystem and have the potential to scale. These projects respect the Blockchain philosophy and help to make the project and ecosystem as decentralized as possible. MakerDAO, Uniswap and Kleros are some examples of legitimate projects which helps bring tremendous value to the ecosystem and helps to make it secure, transparent and scalable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Regular users: Let’s put some fiat in Blockchain</h2>

        <p>
          Regular users constitute people who invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in some way or the other. In general, the users do not have
          much knowledge about how blockchain technology works and what it's in’s and out’s but these people are interested in technology and want to make
          money by investing options. The users also show interest because of hype in Youtube and social media which attracts users to invest in cryptocurrency.
          One of the examples can be of people going to ‘Bitcoin houses’ because they hear information about it on television.
        </p>

        <h3>Synthetic Persona of a Regular User</h3>
        <img class="image" src="${RegularUserPersona}" alt="Synthetic Persona of a Regular Crypto User" />

        <h2>Crypto Bidders and Gamers: kitty’s won’t take down your network</h2>

        <p>
          Bidders and gamers create an exciting new world of value with the help of Blockchain in the crypto space. They challenge the protocol especially when
          it comes to scalability as they put the multiple transactions to go through the system in a short interval of time.
        </p>

        <p>
          On one hand blockchain technology via the Ethereum platform with low transaction cost is used to develop a public and sealed bid for the bidders while
          on the other hand, gaming is moving towards being an excellent force in the crypto space. The time is not far when your favorite gaming character
          will be placed on a bid for a few Ethers as a whole new exciting world of value is being coded into life right now by gamers.
        </p>

        <h2>Early Adapters: Movers, Shakers and Millionaires</h2>

        <p>
          Generally, early crypto adapters is a name given to those people who are the first users and testers of the technology. They start by exploring
          the in’s and out’s of technology and make informed decisions over whether to invest in cryptocurrencies or not. Usually, early crypto adopters are people
          who make everybody else think the technology is safe and useful. Coinbase is one of the early adopters (2012) and one of the largest names in the crypto space
          which allows merchants to accept payments in a variety of digital currencies.
        </p>

        <h2>Scammers: They exist for the #hash</h2>

        <legend>Wasu Wasu Wasu...Wasted!!</legend>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, the crypto ecosystem is not always about la vie est belle (life is beautiful) and is often accompanied by scammers who seek new and innovative ways
          to flaw the cryptocurrency system. Scammers are part of the crypto ecosystem and in 2018 alone, $1.8 billion was lost in cryptocurrency-related crimes.
        </p>

        <h3>Synthetic Persona of Scammers</h3>
        <img class="image" src="${ScammersPersona}" alt="Crypto scammer persona" />

        <h2>Crypto Pirates: they exist to make a hack</h2>

        <p>
          Pirates constitute a group of projects which exist to rob projects, exchange platforms or wallets for monetary gains. Once a wallet or exchange is hacked,
          the anonymous nature of blockchain technology makes it close to impossible to recover the stolen funds. As history has told us, the narrow unguarded
          routes are more vulnerable to pirate attacks, similarly, pirates in the crypto ecosystem always look to target unguarded, unsecure and loosely bounded code.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, pirates help solidify the ecosystem as what’s lost in millions of dollars today can be billions tomorrow. It also provides an opportunity
          for builders and crypto enthusiasts to work on new projects and help the ecosystem become more secure.
        </p>

        <img class="image" src="${PiratesPersona}" alt="Crypto pirates persona" />

        <h2>Traders: The ones make the crypto weather on the market</h2>

        <p>Generally there are 3 types of traders which exist in the crypto ecosystem”</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Traditional traders</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrency traders</li>
          <li>Stakers/Farmers</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Traditional traders</h3>

        <p>
          These carry more experience when it comes to trading and have been involved in the trading ecosystem for a long time. They have experience over how
          the crypto market works and usually are very active in this ecosystem.
        </p>

        <img class="image" src="${PiratesPersona}" alt="Crypto pirates persona" />
        <legend><a href="http://www.cryptoweather.online">It’s trading in every possible direction</a></legend>

        <h3>Cryptocurrency traders</h3>

        <p>
          These traders are usually new to the ecosystem and are still in early stages of crypto trading. Trading in cryptomarket is difficult as it is filled
          with trap and market manipulation with added risk of platform and wallet hacks which eventually leads to losing money and loss of trust.
          Traders in the crypto ecosystem are people who invest in cryptocurrency to have long term or short term gains.
        </p>

        <quote>“Money for nothing but with an effort”</quote>

        <p>
          Traders also take advantage of flash loans as they can take collateral free loans and use it for whatever purpose. The main advantage being the loan,
          trade and re-payment are all bundled together on the same block in Ethereum digital ledger. As per Aave, it processed  more than $2 billion of flash loans in 2020.
        </p>

        <h3>Crypto Stackers/Farmers</h3>

        <p>
          Stakers as the name constitute does not embrace themselves in traditional trading group but is more like getting equity in stock market.
          Staking is different form traditional trading and involves actively participating in transaction validation on proof of stake blockchain.
        </p>

        <h4>1. Stakers</h4>

        <p>
          Stakers are the people who lock coins for validation of transactions and earn rewards in return with proof of stake. In contrast to proof of work which involves mining
          to add new blocks, proof of stake chains produce and validate new blocks through the process of staking. The stakers can lock their cryptocurrency and protocol assigns
          the right to one of them to validate the next block. The stakers are rewarded based on the number of coins stacked, duration of validator for being an active staker,
          the inflation rate or other factors. At this time, ETH 2.0 staking pool is biggest with 524,288 ETH being staked with interest returns ranging from 4% to 17% PA.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more information you can visit the Ethereum website.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Farmers</h4>

        <p>
          Farmers are the people who earn money or rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. The idea is to deposit money in a liquidity pool which acts as a marketplace where users can lend,
          borrow or exchange tokens. The fees generated during transactions are equally distributed to the liquidity providers based on their share on the pool. Though this is not entirely
          which represents farming in crypto ecosystem, this is one of the most famous farming strategy in market.
        </p>

        <h3>Synthetic Persona of Crypto Traders</p>
        <img class="image" src="${TradersPersona}" alt="Crypto traders persona" />

        <h2>Regulators: The ones who want to take charge (at least a bit)</h2>

        <img class="image" src="${RegulatorsControl}" alt="Regulators in the cryptospace" />
        <legend>But do we really need an off-chain regulation? 🤫</legend>

        <p>
        While originally proclaimed to be anonymous, crypto currency transactions today are considered as transparent and safe. Governments have observed the rise of black-market trading
        using Bitcoin and other crypto currencies in the past and hence have now imposed anti money laundering regulations on cryptocurrency traders.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some countries have listed crypto currencies as property which means anything which is purchased using crypto currencies is liable to be taxed as a capital gain.
        </p>

        <h3>Synthetic Persona of Crypto Regulators</p>
        <img class="image" src="${RegulatorsPersona}" alt="Crypto regulators persona" />

        <h2>Mix of crypto typology of the personas</h2>

        <p>
          Then there are actors in the crypto ecosystem who belong to many categories and are involved with Blockchain in some way or the other. A good example can be of a Blockchain developer
          who receives salary in cryptocurrency and is also involved in the trading ecosystem to swap crypto to fiat currency. Another example is of an investor who has technical skill to audit
          a Blockchain project and analyse whether the project has the potential to be part of a legitimate project or not.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
        Crypto ecosystem comprises multiple players all contributing a part to the ecosystem in some way or the other. While on one hand fun projects like crypto kitty help make the system more resilient
        with multiple transactions happening in a short span of time, scammers and pirates always motivate the crypto enthusiast to work on projects which makes the ecosystem more secure, transparent and trustless.
        Of course it is not an exhaustive list and we continue to see multiple actors coming and playing their part as the ecosystem evolves and adoption grows.
        </p>
