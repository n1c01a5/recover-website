          Flight Delay Insurance is one of the very first use cases of the Blockchain Ethereum
        </p>
        <p>
          In traditional transactions, both the parties (payee and the payer) are always concerned
          about foul play or mistrust. The payer is usually concerned about the products/services
          they will receive and payee for money being received.
        <p>

        <p>
          To fix this, an escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party is responsible
          for regulating and payment of funds which is required for multiple parties involved
          in a given transaction. The third-party involved only releases the funds when all terms
          of the contract are respected. It helps in the transaction being more secure
          as the funds are kept in an escrow account which is managed by the arbitrator.
          Also, it adds an extra level of trust both parties have for the Escrow so chances of foul play are less.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are certain obligations that need to be fulfilled before a payment is released and in case
          the terms of the contract are not respected a dispute can be raised.
        </p>

        <p>
          Escrow technology [add lien other article] takes care of your transaction without fraud or risk of losing money.
          It is always better to trust Escrow than making a handshake deal which can result in foul play afterward.
        </p>

        <p>
        In parallel, a new ecosystem of Blockchain is growing up, and to utilize its full potential we need to create insurance
        adapted for the new challenges which can also be used to improve the actual insurance service. Especially when we talk about Blockchain,
        the insurance industry is pretty reluctant to try the technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, the insurance industry is likely to benefit from Blockchain technology which will not only help
          in cutting the cost but will also increase efficiency, enhance customer experience, improve data quality,
          and collection. By adopting innovative ways, insurance companies can help increase their market share,
          gain a competitive advantage, and create an approach to deliver high-quality service.
        </p>

        <p>
          Research shows that 46% of insurers will likely integrate blockchain technology within their ecosystem
          in the next two years and a whopping 84% believes that blockchain and smart contracts will revolutionize
          the way companies engage with partners.
        </p>

        <h2>Insurance for On-chain ecosystem and some insurance solutions</h2>

        <img class="image" src="${OnChainSolution}" alt="On-chain insurance" />
        <legend>
          Even though the technology is new, learning about insurance solutions in
          on-chain system will help you in a longer run

          The past has shown us the importance of having insurance when it comes to the fraud being committed
          on an on-chain ecosystem. Before we discuss some proposed solutions let us discuss the two main issues
          that challenge the on-chain ecosystem which needs insurance:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Smart contract hacks</li>
          <li>
            ICOs
            <ul>
              <li>Malicious Fundraising</li>
              <li>Fundraising hacks</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Smart contract hacks</h3>

        <p>
          Smart contracts are hailed for their ease of use and relatively low cost, but despite this
          Smart contracts have some vulnerabilities and are not away from the eye of hackers.
          As per a study, 1 in 20 smart contracts are at risk [1].
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us look at 2 famous smart contract hacks on on-chain ecosystem:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            As DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) works with a set of
            rules encoded in a smart contract, they are vulnerable to hacks and foul
            play. One such hack happened in June, 2016 when $3.6 million worth of
            Ether was stolen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wallet hacks are generally common as they require a private key to steal
            the cryptocurrencies. One such incident happened with Parity when a
            hacker managed to steal 150,000 ethers by exploiting the smart contract.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img class="image" src="${SmartContractHack}" alt="On-chain insurance" />
        <legend>
          In few seconds, smart contracts are drained of several million
          in an almost anonymous way
        </legend>

        <p>
          In total, the hackers have managed to steal around $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency
          since the beginning of 2017 [2]. This shows that even if Blockchain is hailed for its security features,
          it is vulnerable to attacks as fraudulent transactions can’t be reversed like in traditional financial
          systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Solutions to insure stakeholders from hacks and foul play</h3>

        <p>
        To secure the stakeholders from such hacks and to gain confidence over the system, it is important
        to frame an insurance fund which can be used in case of such hacks/frauds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the solutions that can help protect the users from financial fraud/loss are:

        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the solutions that can help protect the users from financial fraud/loss are:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Internal insurance solutions</li>
          <li>External insurance solutions</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1. Internal insurance solutions: Using a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to insure your project</h3>

        <p>
        For projects driven by a DAO, partial transaction fees can be kept to a
        fund to insure any hacks. This way if the system is hacked, the user(s)
        is covered partially or completely from the loss.
        To have an example, in Decentralized exchange, an insurance fund can
        be set up for the users. Each transaction carried out should contribute
        a part to the fund so if in any case the DEX platform is hacked, the users
        are secured with the funded amount.
        </p>

        <h3>2. 2. External insurance solutions: Use on chain third party service (smart contract layer) to insure your project</h3>

        <p>
          There is also global decentralized insurance which acts as a safety net
          for the DeFi ecosystem which ranges from wallet, smart contracts,
          product and service insurance. It helps for example protect investors
          and service providers in the event of a hack, unintended activities or
          service disruptions.
          Projects have come up with solutions to safeguard smart contracts and
          gain trust of regular users. They have done it by providing a smart
          contract cover derived from an idea of sharing risk to gain confidence of
          the stakeholders.
        </p>

        <h4>There are 4 main projects which offers such solutions:<h4>

        <h5>Ethersic</h5>

        <p>
          The first decentralized insurance leveraging blockchain
          by providing insurance against flight delay, hurricane protection,
          crypto wallets, crop insurance etc. If we talk specifically of flight
          delay insurance service, Ethersic [lien] has a Decentralised Application
          (DApp) which manages the whole process from detection of delayed
          flight to automatic payout using a risk sharing pool.
        </p>

        <h5>Nexus Mutual</h5>

        <p>
          It is another risk sharing pool insurance [lien] which is
          creating decentralized insurance on Ethereum. Initially launching
          with smart contract cover, it allows anyone to purchase insurance on
          any public Ethereum smart contract.
        </p>

        <h5>Cover</h5>

        <p>
          Moving forward with the discussion, another relevant solution
          for on-chain systems is of Cover [lien] (a predictive market for DeFi insurance)
          which helps to insure DeFi by letting the market determine the price
          by having two fungible tokens named CLAIM and NO-CLAIM which
          works accordingly if a claim is validated or not.
        </p>

        <h5>Unslashed</h5>

        <p>
          Another early stage project is Unslashed [lien] which helps to
          insure hacks, smart contract failure/malfunction etc. Recently,
          Unslashed launched a coverage protocol which allows you to
          stake Ethereum or other native token to provide insurance to
          whatever service or smart contract you want to stake against.
        </p>

        <h3>ICOs</h3>

        <h4>Malicious Fundraising</h4>

       <embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwDbx-nuQ5o" width="100%" height="333" />
        <legend>
          Bitconnect, one of the most epic ponzi schemes. A fraudulent way
          to raise funds, where new entrants to the system pay the old ones
        </legend>

        <p>
          Some projects have surfed on the hype of the blockchain to launch ponzi schemes. Among the projects, the best known are Bitconnet and OneCoin.
          These projects often take advantage of people's lack of knowledge and the lure of gain with very large profits to convince future users.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the ways to fight these frauds is to educate. Of course, these systems will not offer insurance because these systems are bound
          to collapse one day or another if there are no new entrants. In a way, the lack of insurance is a good indicator of whether a project is viable or not.
        </p>

        <h4>Fundraising Hacks</h4>

        <p>
          On the blockchain, most projects are funded by ICOs (Initial Coin Offering). ICO’s have gained incredible popularity over the past years as
          many companies use them simply because they were being turned down for funding traditional VC’s and financial institutions.
        </p>

        <img class="image" src="${FaceAfterGettingHacked}" alt="Face after getting be hacked" />
        <legend>
          In few seconds, smart contracts are drained of several million
          in an almost anonymous way
        </legend>

        <p><b>So, what are the issues concerning ICO’s?</b></p>

        <p>
          Like any other unregulated financial mechanism, ICO’s have been risky, immature and vulnerable. For new startups, which have less knowledge
          over how ICO’s function and what to expect, they are susceptible to fraud and misinformation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because in some cases ICO’s are unregulated, there are generally two ways how fraud/hack can happen in an ICO:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Founder tokens sold as there is no safe vault to keep them</li>
          <li>The founders try to take away crypto money (ETH, Bitcoin)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let’s look of the Veritaseum hack for example:</p>

        <p>
          This took place in the ICO of VER ERC-20 tokens i.e.
          the tokens of Veritaseum, a P2P financial market platform. In this case,
          the wallets belonging to several project leads were compromised and
          the tokens were transferred to an unknown wallet that belonged to
          an unknown address and then sold back to unsuspecting investors.
        </p>

        <p>
        The above example signifies that if the number of scams and failed ICO’s keeps on increasing, it can take a toll on the community. This will also make it harder for honest finders to access this method of funding as people will lose trust and will fear getting hacked. As per Ernst and Young, roughly 10% of funds raised through ICOs between 2015 and 2017 have been lost or stolen via hacks [3].
        </p>

        <p>What can be the solutions to insure fundraise hacks?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            One of the solutions is set on increment payment workflow. If everything
            is moving as per the defined guidelines and the project provides value
            for the investors on a continuous basis, the investment will flow else
            the investors have the access to stop the money flow to the project
            if something fishy is detected. StreamPay is one such example
            which focuses on providing continuous value transfer by real
            time payments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Crypto-native Insurance: They are on-chain insurance covering
            protocols and DAO’s which are still on the building stage which have
            a potential to insure DeFi that has grown expansively over the last year.
            Though, there are lots of challenges at bay like market structure,
            payout decisions, creating and evaluating coverage but once they
            are navigated it will provide an opportunity to insure billions of dollars
            in DeFi today and trillions in global commerce.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Insurance for the off-chain ecosystem and some insurance solutions</h2>

        <p>
          Off-chain insurance is used to help insure the centralized/off-chain wallets from hacks or
          foul play which will result in securing stakeholder’s invested value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Off-chain governance allows the intervention into the blockchain protocol which is not defined
          or prescribed by the ecosystem itself i.e. by outside authorities. This means that your money or
          cryptocurrency is managed by an external centralized organization which can bring some amount of
          risk to investment.
        </p>

        <p>See 2 use cases:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Capital on some Centralised Exchange Platforms (CEXs)</li>
          <li>Physical assets</li>
        </ul>

          Centralized exchanges/crypto wallets are in charge of custody of assets deposited by their users
          and usually act as intermediaries who facilitate trading in their platform in exchange for some fees.
          They also provide friendly User Experience (UX) for amateur users and are known to offer fiat-crypto
          conversion in less time.

            CoinDash hack:<br />
            CoinDash is described as a crypto-based social
            selling platform designed to help create and maintain a winning portfolio
            of cryptocurrencies. In 2017, during the company ICO, visitors to the site
            were asked to transfer Ethereum into another address to participate in
            the ICO. Within half an hour, $7 million worth of Ethereum in about
            2130 transactions was hacked and routed to the hacker’s wallet.

            Coinbase and Gate.io hack: Hackers gained access to more than half
            of computer networking power and was using it to rewrite
            transaction history. This led to spending the same cryptocurrency more
            than once which is called ‘double spends’. $1.1 million was at stake
            but nothing was stolen. In parallel, Gate.io reported losing around $200,000.

        To empower users to use more of CEX and help build their trust, some solutions
        can be put into place. To insure the safety of CEX, it is a potential option
        to integrate traditional insurance with Blockchain insurance. This way the insurer will be
        covered with traditional rules and laws but with an added advantage of a distributed ledger.
        With the mix of two, the traditional insurance practices can be rightly improved using distributed
        ledger and hence the option to explore security from hacks and foul play.

        Today’s insurance industry faces many challenges including unknown or fraudulent past data and inefficient
        contract placement which results in incorrect insurance value and a ton of manual intervention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking the use case of car insurance, because of so many intermediaries and poor history of insurance,
        driver behavior, accident history, it is difficult to estimate the true cost of insurance which usually
        leads to a lot of inefficiency and value estimation. The same goes for house insurance where there is
        no information about the previous owner, the materials used or the building which helps being vital
        for understanding the insurance value and policy.

      <h4>Blockchain technology to rescue your car/house</h4>

      <p>
      The use of technology will help save the previous history of the driver/house owner stored in a distributed ledger.
      This will help the insurance company follow the history and behavior of an insured customer which will help them
      frame the right policy. This will not only help the process be transparent but will also help remove unnecessary
      intermediaries. Studies claim implementation of Blockchain can lead to insurance claims being 3 times faster and 5 times cheaper [4].
      </p>

      <p>
      In parallel, we need smart contracts that trigger the predefined actions, and to verify whether the actual event
      actually took place or not with Kleros being used as an oracle. In simple terms, Oracle is a trusted off-chain third party
      that feeds data to smart contracts so that they can trigger the pre-defined code.

        Another interesting way to get the best value for your assets is by using an on-chain solution based on
        prediction markets. The most famous projects being Augur and Gnosis which allow people to buy/sell shares
        based on the potential outcome of an event. They use openness and decentralization of Blockchain to allow
        a wide variety of people to participate in trading. This service can be used by putting a collateral for
        a result. For example, being a restaurant owner one can make a bet that there will be a new pandemic and
        if it turns out to be true, the restaurant will win the bet despite being turned down.
      </p>
      <!--
      <h3>Another Bonus: Interesting Research to estimate the risk => Move to on-chain insurance</h3>

      <p>
        We want to share an interesting research which can be useful for estimating risk in a decentralised ecosystem. Proposal has been made to derive a mathematical model to estimate and to prize the risk associated with Blockchain in case of financial loss occurred due to fraud and foul play. Using advanced probability theory, one way is proposed to find how a bad smart contract code can affect the assigned values of smart contracts and how prediction theory can predict the price at risk in case of fraud. This can help estimate the loss and reimbursement of the affected wallet. In this case we use the power of smart contract transparency to investigate the damage. More information can be found in the link [5].
      </p>

      -->

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Blockchain can be a decisive factor in revolutionizing the insurance industry and can help it break free from
        traditional insurance practices. As new technologies are rising each day, customers are craving transparency,
        speed, and less costly transactions which are not centrally controlled.
        Having seen that Blockchain has a tremendous potential to decrease fraud, people will feel more protected and

        While Blockchain looks like a hopeful solution, it has its own obstacles. The new laws concerning the use of
        Blockchain in insurance like personal data of customers residing in Blockchain must comply with existing data
        regulatory boards. In parallel, data in Blockchain is publicly available, which means each transaction
        can be traced back to its previous block, the user information can potentially be accessed by fraudulent
        groups and hackers.

        As discussed, some challenges still need to be resolved with DeFii, wallets ICO’s being a major concern,
        but with emerging applications and more companies collaborating to provide a fast, secure and transparent service
